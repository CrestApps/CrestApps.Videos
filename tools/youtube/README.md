# Publishing to YouTube

`youtube.py` publishes the videos of this repository to the CrestApps YouTube channel through the YouTube Data API v3,
and keeps each video's YouTube metadata in its `video.json`.

```bash
pip install -r tools/youtube/requirements.txt
python tools/youtube/youtube.py auth                                   # once per machine
python tools/youtube/youtube.py release <slug> --file <mp4>             # draft release; publishing it uploads
python tools/youtube/youtube.py publish <slug> --file <mp4>             # or upload from this machine
python tools/youtube/youtube.py update <slug>                          # after editing video.json
python tools/youtube/youtube.py chapters <slug> --build videos/<slug>/build
python tools/youtube/youtube.py description <slug>                     # preview what YouTube gets
python tools/youtube/youtube.py index                                  # rewrite the table in README.md
```

## Publishing a video

A video goes to YouTube when its **release is published**:

1. Merge the video's folder to `main` (storyboard, scenes, captions, `thumbnail.jpg`, `video.json`).
2. Create the draft release of its next version, with the MP4 attached:

   ```bash
   python tools/youtube/youtube.py release <slug> --file videos/<slug>/build/master.mp4
   ```

   This tags `<slug>/v1` (then `v2`, ...) on `main`. A draft is visible only to the repository's members: watch the
   video on the release page.
3. **Publish the release** on GitHub. The **Publish video** workflow then:
   - uploads the MP4 with the title, description, chapters, links, tags, captions, thumbnail and playlists of
     `video.json` (scheduled with `publishAt` when it is set);
   - makes the previous version unlisted when this is `v2` or later, since YouTube can't replace a video's file;
   - commits the YouTube id to `video.json` and the README index, and adds the link to the release notes;
   - opens a pull request in CrestApps.OrchardCore that writes the id into `src/CrestApps.Docs/src/data/videos.json`,
     which every `<YouTube video="<slug>" />` on the docs pages reads.

To run it again for a release (after adding a missing secret, say), use **Run workflow** with the tag.

Changing a published video's title, description or chapters needs no release: edit `video.json` and merge, and the
**YouTube metadata** workflow updates YouTube.

### Repository secrets

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET` | The OAuth client created below |
| `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` | The `refresh_token` in the token file `auth` writes |
| `DOCS_REPOSITORY_TOKEN` | A fine-grained token for **CrestApps/CrestApps.OrchardCore** with **Contents** and **Pull requests** set to read and write, so the workflow can open the documentation pull request. Without it the video is still published, and the workflow says which line to add to the docs by hand. |

## One-time setup

The API only acts for a Google account that signed in and granted access, so a person with access to the CrestApps
channel does this once:

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project (for example "CrestApps Videos")
   and enable the **YouTube Data API v3**.
2. Under **Google Auth Platform**, configure the consent screen as **External**, add the scopes
   `youtube.upload` and `youtube.force-ssl`, and add the channel owner's account as a test user. Then **publish the
   app** ("In production"): while it stays in testing, its refresh tokens expire after 7 days. An unverified app in
   production still works for the accounts that sign in to it; Google shows them a warning first.
3. Create an **OAuth client ID** of type **Desktop app**, download its JSON, and save it as
   `tools/youtube/client_secret.json` (git-ignored), or point `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRETS` at it.
4. Run `python tools/youtube/youtube.py auth`, sign in with the account that owns the CrestApps channel (pick the
   channel if it's a brand account), and allow access. The token is kept in `~/.crestapps-videos/youtube-token.json`,
   outside the repository.

## What the API allows, and what it doesn't

- **Uploads from an unaudited API project are locked to private.** YouTube restricts every video uploaded through
  `videos.insert` by a project that hasn't passed its [API compliance audit](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form)
  to private viewing, and it can't be made public. Either request the audit once, which is free and takes a few weeks,
  or upload in YouTube Studio and use this tool for everything else (captions, thumbnail, metadata updates and the
  index), which isn't restricted. Record a Studio upload's id in `video.json` as `"youtube": { "id": "...", "url": "https://youtu.be/..." }`.
- **Quota**: 10,000 units a day by default. A full publish (upload 1,600, captions 400, thumbnail 50, playlist 50,
  plus a playlist lookup) costs about 2,150, so about four videos a day; the audit form can ask for more.
- **Not in the API**: end screens, cards, monetization and pinning a comment are set in YouTube Studio.
- **Custom thumbnails** need a channel with phone verification or channel history; the tool reports when YouTube
  refuses one.
- **AI disclosure**: uploads declare synthetic media (`containsSyntheticMedia`), because the narration is a neural voice.
- **Chapters** come from the timestamps in the description; the first must be `0:00`, and there must be at least three.
